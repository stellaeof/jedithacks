In general, I like jEdit a lot.  It's my favorite editor and I know that
whatever system I go to, it will be available (Mac, Linux, Windows).  There
are platform specific editors that I sometimes like better, but its the best
to be everywhere.

BUT, there are some things about it that make me go stark raving mad.  This
little git repo contains my patches, mode updates and a convenient script
that checks out, builds and installs the updates on a computer.

Hacks

1. Explicit Electric Keys in Modes
jEdit makes some crazy assumptions on what keys you want to cause an immediate
re-indent of the current line and there is no way to override in a mode file.
Most C-like languages end up re-indenting on {}[]: characters.  I find that
this is always messing me up, especially with respect to the open brace and
bracket characters.  The patch 100-explicit_electric.diff makes some source level
changes to support an explicitElectricKeys mode property that, if present,
completely trumps all other logic for determining electric keys.  The modes I've
packaged use this property to only enable certain keys for re-indent.
